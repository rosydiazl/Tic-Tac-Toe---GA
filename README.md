# ROSY'S TIC-TAC-TOE GAME: A DESCRIPTION

 Welcome to my website.

This application allows users to create an account if they don't have one or log in if they're a returning user. The fun part is that they can play a game of Tic-Tac-Toe once they've logged in to their account! After the user is done playing, they can sign out if they prefer and then log back in once they're ready to play again.
 
 I wanted to do this project because I wanted to get more experience using different programming languages, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript as well as different technologies, like APIs.

## PLANNING: 

### USER STORIES (TIC-TAC-TOE GAME) 

 
1. As a user, I want to be able to log in if I have an account so that I can play the game. 
   
2. As a user, I want to be able to sign up if I don’t have an account so I can play the game. 

3. As a user, I want to be able to log out after I’m signed in. 

4. As a user, after logging in or creating an account, I want to be able to play the game.  

5. As a user, I want to be able to select the box to place my move as long as that box is empty.   

6. As a user, if I mark 3 consecutive boxes with X the game is over and X wins. If O marks 3 in a row, O wins. If neither does but there are no more empty spaces, it’s a tie. 

7. As a user, I want to be able to see who wins the game or if it is a tie. 

8. As a user, I want to be able to restart the game.
